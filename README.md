# Wilma Head of Train Device (HOTD)

A "dumb" ETD can be as simple as a red flag attached to the coupler on the last car of the train, whereas "smart" devices monitor functions such as brake line pressure and accidental separation of the train using a motion sensor, functions that were previously monitored by a crew in the caboose. The ETD transmits data via a telemetry link to the Head-of-Train Device (HTD) in the locomotive, known colloquially among railroaders as a "Wilma", a play on the first name of the wife of cartoon character Fred Flintstone. In Canada, this device is known as a sense and braking unit (SBU).

A typical HTD contains several lights indicating telemetry status and rear end movement, along with a digital readout of the brake line pressure from the ETD. It also contains a toggle switch used to initiate an emergency brake application from the rear end. In modern locomotives, the HTD is built into the locomotive's computer system, and the information is displayed on the engineer's computer screen.

Railroads have strict government-approved air brake testing procedures for various circumstances when assembling trains or switching out cars en route. After a cut is made between cars in a train and the train is rejoined, in addition to other tests, the crew must verify that the brakes apply and release on the rear car (to ensure that all of the brake hoses are connected and the angle cocks, or valves, are opened). In most cases, the engineer is able to use information from the ETD to verify that the air pressure reduces and increases at the rear of the train accordingly, indicating proper brake pipe continuity. This device is said to constitute a fail-safe condition.

# Installation

1. Click the "Clone or Download" button on the righthand side of the screen and select "Download Zip."
2. Open the Zip file using a program like WinZip or WinRar, if it didn't open automatically.
3. Navigate __INTO__ the "wilma-head-of-train-device-master" Folder. You should see two items: a file named "titus's_ultra_realistic_roller_&_weathering-e2.txt", and readme.md.
4. Extract the two folders directly into: `<Your active steam directory>\SteamApps\common\Garry's Mod\garrysmod\data\expression2\`.
The file path should then look like `expression2\titus's_ultra_realistic_roller_&_weathering-e2.txt`.

You will also need Metaladon's Models for it to work correctly.

If you're currently in-game in Garry's Mod, open the E2 Editor, and click the "Update" button under the list of E2s on the left hand side of the window.


# Wiring

To Wire:
1. Begin by spawning the E2 on the Bogie, or Locomotive.
2. Wire `E1` and `E2` to each Bogie. (This E2 does two bogies at once to limit the need of two e2s)
3. Wire `Slipping` to the RLCs "Wheelslip" Output

**NOTE:** This E2 can be Parented!

**NOTE No.2:** It is perfectly normal for the E2 to error out when you first spawn it, you MUST wire E1 and E2 to the bogies for it to function correctly. It will automaticlly stop the E2s execution if they are not wired because the E2 may start to break stuff on the server if it isn't inplace.

#### You're Done!
